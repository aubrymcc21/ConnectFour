Project Title: ConnectFour

Date: September 2, 2017

Project Description: This is a simple mimic game of Connect Four written in Java. This was one of the first programming projects I have ever made! It was challenging to figure out when to make a class for what purpose, but I managed to get a good feel for it with this project. 

This program will show an ASCII picture of rows and columns, with the columns numbered, and prompts the player, either Player One or Player Two, to select a column. After you select a column with a number, a token will appear denoting your player number in the selected column. The program ends when Player One or Player Two gets four tokens connected in either a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal order, and the program declares the winner.

To Run: java .\ConnectFour.java

This program requires a Java IDE of some kind to run. It has been tested both with BlueJ and Visual Studio Code.
